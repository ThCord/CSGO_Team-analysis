# CSGO_Team-analysis

This repository contains notebooks of my upcoming Medium articles on how to crunch, clean and analyse a dataset with Pyhton and Pandas. It will be about CS:GO teams and the informations we managed to retrieve from the liquipedia.net/counterstrike API and additional sources.

For now the parts available are :

    Part 01 : fetching data through the API
    Part 02 : extracting and cleaning
