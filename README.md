# CSGO_Team-analysis

This repository contains notebooks of my upcoming Medium articles on how to crunch, clean and analyse a dataset with Pyhton and Pandas. It will be about CS:GO teams and the informations we managed to retrieve from the liquipedia.net/counterstrike API and additional sources.

For now the parts available are :

    Part 00 : [fetching data through the API](https://github.com/ThCord/CSGO_Team-analysis/blob/master/CSGO_Teams-Part01_fetching%20data%20through%20the%20API.ipynb)
    Part 01 : extracting and cleaning
